This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to predict suicide ideation based on various factors such as demographic information and mental health indicators. By detecting early warning signs, timely interventions and support can be provided to those in need, potentially saving lives.")

st.write("To achieve this, I have collected anonymous data from students via questionnaires and surveys. This data will be used to train machine learning models that accurately predict the likelihood of suicide ideation. The models will be evaluated and fine-tuned for better performance.")

Through this project, I hope to contribute to ongoing efforts to address this global challenge and improve the well-being of individuals and communities.")
